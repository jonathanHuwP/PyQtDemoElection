## Possible Improvments

Possible improvments are 
1. Put the names of the parties in the data, allowing a variable number of parties. To achieve 
this the simple dictionary should be replaced by a dedicated class defined in datastructs, comprising
two arrays or  an array and a dictionary.

2. Allow the percentages in the party vote to be editable and distributed pro-rata across constituancies.

3. Add a parliement table showing the resultant parliement.
