# PyQtDemoElection
Demonstration of the structuring of a PyQt5 project, and use of Qt model view.

## Description
This project is the result of a self-teaching exercise in the use of Qt models and
the structuring of a Python/PyQt project.

The choice of a dictionary as the base data structure for the project was driven by
by the use of a dictionary in the project on which we were planning to work.

## Possible Improvements

Possible improvements are

1. Put the names of the parties in the data, allowing a variable number of parties. To achieve
this the simple dictionary should be replaced by a dedicated class defined in data structs, comprising
two arrays or an array and a dictionary.

2. Allow the percentages in the party vote to be editable and distributed pro-rata across constituencies.

3. Add a parliament table showing the resultant parliament.
